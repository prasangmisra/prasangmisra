👋 Hi, I’m @prasangmisra, a full-stack engineer at heart with an overall experience of 7+ years and about 3 years as a Golang Software Engineer.
A curious soul always intrigued by tech, my interest was piqued while working at Mobikwik as an Integration Engineer where I worked across technologies and platforms to integrate the payment wallet for clients like IRCTC, Future Group(BigBazaar), Swiggy, Domino’s, etc.
After working various gigs as full-stack engineer and Payment Operations Manager, I realised my flair for Go Lang hence started my career as a dedicated Golang engineer at Bon and further enhanced my skills at Daimler - MBRDI.
